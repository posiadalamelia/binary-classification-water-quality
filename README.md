# 💧 Binary Classification for Water Quality Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to evaluate the **potability of water samples** using various **binary classification methods**. The goal is to compare the performance of different machine learning models and assess their effectiveness in predicting whether a given water sample is **safe for consumption**.  

## 🔍 Research Objective  
The objective of this study is to analyze water quality based on its **physicochemical parameters** and classify it as **potable or non-potable** using machine learning techniques. The dataset is divided into a **training set** and a **test set**, where one part is used to train the models and the other to evaluate their accuracy.  

## 🏆 Methods Used  
This project utilizes **four classification models** along with **one hybrid model**, which combines two classifiers for enhanced accuracy:  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Random Forest (RF)**  
- **Naïve Bayes (NB)**  
- **Hybrid Model (Combination of Two Models)**  

## 📊 Key Features Analyzed  
The dataset includes **10 key physicochemical features** used to determine water quality:  

✅ **Input Features:**  
- **pH Level** – Measures acidity or alkalinity (ideal: 6.5 - 8.5).  
- **Hardness** – Indicates dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium.  
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** – Reflects mineral content in mg/L.  
- **Chloramines** – Used for disinfection, safe levels ≤ 4 mg/L.  
- **Sulfates** – Naturally occurring compounds, ideal range: 3 - 30 mg/L.  
- **Conductivity** – Measures water’s ability to conduct electricity (ideal ≤ 400 μS/cm).  
- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC)** – Indicates organic matter content (< 2 mg/L for drinking water).  
- **Trihalomethanes (THM)** – Byproducts of chlorine treatment, safe level ≤ 80 ppm.  
- **Turbidity** – Measures clarity of water, ideal ≤ 5 NTU.  

❓ **Target Feature:**  
- **Potability** – 1 (safe to drink) / 0 (not safe to drink).  

## 🔬 Expected Outcomes  
- Identify **the most accurate model** for predicting water potability.  
- Understand the impact of different **water quality parameters** on classification.  
- Provide insights for **water quality monitoring** and public health safety.
